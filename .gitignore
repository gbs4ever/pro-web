# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'
# /config/database.yml
# Ignore bundler config.

.env

.vscode/*      # Maybe .vscode/**/* instead - see comments
.vscode/settings.json
responseCodes.json
# .rubocop.yml
# .rubocop_todo.yml
# Ignore the default SQLite database.
